# Healthcare-Triaging-Application

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts disease and symptom urgency using trained machine learning models. It provides an interactive interface where users can select symptoms and feature values, and receive triage outputs such as predicted disease, urgency, and supporting information.  

# Features
Interactive Streamlit UI with sliders and selectors for patient features.  
Encodes symptom presence/absence from a provided dataset.  
Uses trained Random Forest for disease prediction as well as a deep learning model with multi layer perceptron architecture to predict benign/malignant cancer 
Displays urgency classification and interpretable results.  
Models and encoders are pre-trained and loaded automatically from the models/ folder.
